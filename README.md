Agent based epidemic model design for the purpose of my bachelor thesis at *SGH Warsaw School of Economics* entitled *Agent based modelling of epidemics dynamics* refereed with positivs conclusions on 20.07.2020 and written in *Julia* scientific programming language. The model implementation iteself is included in [ABES.jl](/ABES.jl) file, while the rest of `.jl` files contain necessary calls required to obtain results. The majority of visualisations required for the project, were obtained in separed repository, see [ThesisRAnalysis](https://github.com/jcierocki/ThesisRAnalysis).
